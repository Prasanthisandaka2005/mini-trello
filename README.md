# Task Board Application - README

## Table and API Changes for Different Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Customizable Stages for Task Boards

#### Tables:
- **Boards Table:**
  - Add a `stages` field or column that stores the customized stages for each board. This field could be an array or a JSON structure.

#### API Endpoints:
- **Create Custom Stages:**
  - Add an API endpoint that allows users to create and edit custom stages for a particular board. This endpoint would update the `stages` field in the Boards table.
- **Get Custom Stages:**
  - Modify the API endpoint that retrieves board details to include the custom stages for each board.

#### Updates:
- The Boards table would need an additional field/column to store the custom stages.
- The API would require new endpoints to create and retrieve custom stages for each board.

### Scenario 2: User Comments on Tasks

#### Tables:
- **Tasks Table:**
  - Add a `comments` field or table that stores comments related to each task. The `comments` field could be an array of comment objects with fields like user, text, timestamp, etc.

#### API Endpoints:
- **Add Comment to Task:**
  - Create an API endpoint that allows users to add comments to specific tasks. This endpoint would update the `comments` field for the relevant task.
- **Retrieve Comments for Task:**
  - Add an API endpoint that retrieves comments for a particular task.

#### Updates:
- The Tasks table would need an additional field or table to store comments.
- New API endpoints would be required for adding and retrieving comments associated with tasks.

## Error Handling

Error handling is a crucial aspect of any application. Here's a high-level overview of how error handling could be implemented:

- **Validation Errors:**
  - Validate user input on the client-side and server-side to prevent common data format and integrity issues.
  - Return validation error messages and status codes when input is incorrect.
- **API Request Errors:**
  - Handle API request errors gracefully, providing meaningful error messages and HTTP status codes.
  - Implement retry mechanisms for temporary network issues.
- **Database Errors:**
  - Implement proper error handling for database operations, including catching database connection issues and query errors.
  - Return database-related errors to the client with appropriate error codes.
- **Authentication and Authorization Errors:**
  - Ensure proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place to prevent unauthorized access to resources.
  - Return access denied or unauthorized error responses.
- **Logging and Monitoring:**
  - Implement logging to record errors and exceptions for debugging and monitoring purposes.
  - Use monitoring tools to proactively identify and address issues.
- **User-Friendly Error Messages:**
  - Provide user-friendly error messages that guide users on how to resolve issues or contact support.
- **Fallbacks and Graceful Degradation:**
  - Implement fallback mechanisms or graceful degradation of functionality to ensure the application remains usable even in the presence of errors.
- **Testing and QA:**
  - Thoroughly test the application to identify and fix potential error scenarios during development and quality assurance phases.
- **Documentation:**
  - Document error handling procedures and expected error responses in the API documentation to assist developers and integrators.
